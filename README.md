# NetLimiterPatch

NetLimiterPatch allows you to open Netlimiter 5 Pro even if it is normally disallowed by AntiCheats, \
it is just a 2 minute hex edit of some detected NetLimiter strings. \

## Installation

You must have [NetLimiter 5.2.4.0](https://www.netlimiter.com/releases/5-2-4-0) installed for this particular version to work. \
Just download all the files in this repo as a ZIP by pressing the `Code` button at the top and the ZIP option and extract them somewhere on your PC,
when you want to run it just run the `boss.exe` file as Administrator.\
To ensure easy access to the exe create a shortcut or pin the exe to your taskbar.

## Testing

Tested on Destiny 2, ARK, Warframe, Apex Legends, Overwatch 2 and more and can be opened before the game starts and while the game is open.\
Feel free to test on other games but if you get error coded or banned that's your issue.
