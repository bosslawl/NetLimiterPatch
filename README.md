# NetLimiterPatch

NetLimiterPatch allows you to open Netlimiter 5 Pro even if it is normally disallowed by AntiCheats, it is just a 2 minute hex edit of some detected NetLimiter strings. 

## Installation

- You must have [NetLimiter 5.3.6.0](https://download.netlimiter.com/nl/netlimiter-5.3.6.0.exe) installed for this particular version to work. 
- Just download all the files in this repo as a ZIP by pressing the `Code` button at the top and the ZIP option and extract them somewhere on your PC
- When you want to run it just run the `bosslawl.exe` file as Administrator.
- To ensure easy access to the exe create a shortcut or pin the exe to your taskbar.

## Testing

- Tested on Destiny 2, ARK, Warframe, Apex Legends, Overwatch 2 and more and can be opened before the game starts and while the game is open.
- Feel free to test on other games but if you get error coded or banned that's your issue.
