# NetLimiterPatch

NetLimiterPatch allows you to open Netlimiter 5 Pro even if it is normally disallowed by AntiCheats, it is just a 2 minute hex edit of some detected NetLimiter strings. 

## Installation

- You must have [NetLimiter 5.3.6.0](https://download.netlimiter.com/nl/netlimiter-5.3.6.0.exe) installed for this particular version to work. 
- Simply download the `NetlimiterPatch.exe` file from [releases](https://github.com/bosslawl/NetLimiterPatch/releases/download/alpha/NetLimiterPatch.exe) and run the exe, pick a file location and enjoy.
- When you want to run it just run the `bosslawl.exe` file as Administrator.
- To ensure easy access to the exe create a shortcut or pin the exe to your taskbar.
- To give yourself an unlimited license, copy the `Netlimiter.dll` file from NetlimiterPatch and paste it wherever you installed your **default** Netlimiter (`C:\Program Files\Locktime Software\NetLimiter` by default), in order to paste it you will need to press your windows key and search for `Services` then you must locate a service called `NetLimiter Service`, right-click and press `Stop`, now close this window and paste the file, then open your `bosslawl.exe` file from NetlimiterPatch and press `Start`.

## Testing

- Tested on Destiny 2, ARK, Warframe, Apex Legends, Overwatch 2 and more and can be opened before the game starts and while the game is open.
- Feel free to test on other games but if you get error coded or banned that's your issue.
